# ðŸ“ˆ CodeAlpha - Stock Portfolio Tracker

## Overview
This project is part of my **Python Programming Internship** at **CodeAlpha**.  
The **Stock Portfolio Tracker** lets users enter stock symbols and quantities, calculates the **total investment value** using hardcoded prices, and optionally saves the summary to a `.txt` file.

## Features
- Hardcoded stock prices for quick testing  
- Interactive console input/output  
- Calculates individual stock value and total portfolio value  
- Option to save summary to a text file (`portfolio_summary.txt`)  
- Built with plain Python (no external libraries required)

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Dictionaries, loops, conditionals  
- Basic file handling
